## Learning
There's so much to learn. A search engine is the best teacher right now. Between wargames, CTFs, online resources, the amount to learn is far too vast to even describe here. However, with time, dedication, and effort, becoming an expert can be fun :smile:.

There's some resources in this repo, that will be updated as time goes on, but for now there's:

* `blog_roll.md` - a list of blogs to follow, read, and learn from
* `book_list.md` - a list of books to read, and learn from

This section will be updated as time progresses. For now, here's some links to self learn from:

* [A brief intro book to modern offensive security](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/index.html)
* [RPISec Modern Binary Exploitation Course](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE)
* [NYU's own Hack Night](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night)
* [Russian CTF Course](https://github.com/xairy/mipt-ctf) - Use Google Translate
* [Exploit Development](http://expdev-kiuhnm.rhcloud.com/)
* [Hackers Hut](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/) - Random hacking hints, mainly from a Linux point of view
* [Open Security Training](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Training.html) - Huge assortment of free security training curated by Xeno Kovah

If you make it through half of those links, you're now smarter than 50% of engineers in security.

## Getting help
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is an invaluable source for learning, getting help, and meeting smart people. Most relevant open source software has a channel, or a presence in some channel. If you're new to IRC, a quick start is to just download [Quassel](http://www.quassel-irc.org/), there's a server, client, and all-in-one package for most operating systems. You probably want the all-in-one, left as an exercise to the reader in downloading and installing software.

There's a lot of servers out there, but the most active public one is `irc.freenode.net`. **0xBU's own channel on there is `#0xBU`.**

Once you connect to `irc.freenode.net`, you can join it with `/join #0xBU`, or through some GUI pressing.

### IRC Channels
Everything on this list is on freenode.

* ##re
* ##crypto
* ##programming
* ##security
* ##c
* #radare
* #python

You can contact me on IRC, `kolobyte`, or by email, small hacking challenge is to find it.

## Wargames
Somewhat ordered by difficulty, easiest at the top. Some focus on different things, try them out and see which you find the most fun. There's plenty more not listed here.

* [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)
* [Bandit @ overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)
* [Vortex @ overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/)
* [ringzer0](http://www.ringzer0team.com/home)

These are the most fun, but most challenging:

* [Pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/?p=main)
* [Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
* [Reversing.kr](http://reversing.kr/index.php)
* [CrackMes](http://crackmes.de/)
* [Reverse Engineering Challenges](http://challenges.re/)
